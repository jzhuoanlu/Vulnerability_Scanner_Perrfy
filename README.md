# Vulnerability_Scanner_Perrfy
Scans a URL for vulnerabilities then crawls and scans its internal urls

To use, just run the route.py (I set up the flask application without worrying too much about the configurations). You will get a form to submit a url. Submit the url you want to test for sql injection vulnerabilities. The application will stall as it scans that url and crawls to other internal urls to scan as well. When it is finished it will send you to a new page that displays if the url is vulnerable to sql injections. If it is a form that is vulnerable to sql injections, then it would also display the vulnerable form. Below that, it will display information of the internal urls that are crawled. They will simiply be displayed as a dictionary. If the url is vulnerable, then the value of the key 'vul' would be true for that url.
